### Lending Case Study


## Problem Statement
* Identification of risky load applicants with EDA is the aim of this case study. Identify the risky loan applicants so that such loans amount can be reduced to cutting down the amount of credit loss.  To understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.

Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface.Â The aim of this case study is to identify risky loan applicants based on several factors. 

## Analysis:
### Analysis can be devided into four main parts:
-> Understanding data (Individual columns through the data dictionary provided)
-> Data cleaning (Eliminating nulls or missing values & removing unwanted columns that do not contribute to the analysis)
-> Data Analysis - (Standardize the specific column types, analyse using univariate, bivariate variables, plot graphs)
-> Provide recommendations (Based on the various plots generated against different variables)

## Conclusions

- Most important variables required to analyse the loan prediction:

2. Interest Rate
3. Employee Length
4. Annual Income
5. Grade 
6. Sub-grade
7. Term
8. Address State

- Employement Length:
Default rate is high for employees with <= 3 year and >=10 years experience

- Interest Rate:

1. Grade B => B3, B5, B4
2. Grade C => C3, C4, C5
3. Grade D => D3, D4, D5
Term:
Default rate increases with Term increase.

- Address State:
Default rates are high for NV(Nevada), AK(Alaska)
